# Overview
FIFA is a very popular series of football video games, developed and published by
Electronic Arts (EA). 

It is arguably one of the most successful series in the video games business, selling 
millions of copies around the world.

The game has different gameplay modes (e.g., friendly matches, tournaments, online matches). 
Among these modes there is also the Fifa Ultimate Team Mode, where the user can simulate the entire career
of a coach and football manager of a team.

According to this gameplay mode, the human player, as the coach/general manager of the team,
is expected  to take numerous decisions,  critical to his/her team development and progress. 
One of the key responsibilities of the general manager is to decide which players to buy or sell. 

In this context, it would be desirable to have a data-driven system helping the general manager
to take these decisions. Clearly, the goal of such system would be correctly estimate the actual market
value of each player, so that the general manager of the team can take an informed decision.
